To Do:
- Get error on game implementation fixed
- do stage 1a and 1b
- get information about stage 2

stage 1a:
- output final state of board as PGM image, including size of board and number of turns processed in the filename:
using writePgmImage in pgm.go, size of board an dnumber of turns passed into writePgmImage function
- create a slice of cells that are alive and send it on the alive channel:
using distributor in gol.go -> send on alive channel

stage 1b:


main.go
- all channel -> given in structs e.g iodistributor
gameoflife- > initialises lots of the channels
- stage 1 -> channel for output of image
output val channnels which hlds values
pgm.go -> TODO

main.go main called for build
gof called for tests
start go routines in gol function at bottom
gol.go process game of life
gol.go game of life login in 				world[y][x] = world[y][x] ^ 0xFF
pgm.go TODO bit

control.go -> stage 2./baseline


-- print board function into terminal
-- need to write into a new board -> world[y][x] -> write to target array, source array target array
--test and do benchmar at each stage e.g 1a 1b
